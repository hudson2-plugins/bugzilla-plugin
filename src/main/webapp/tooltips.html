<div>
  Enables tooltips feature.  When disabled, bugs are hyperlinked only.  When enabled, bugs are hyperlinked, and 
  the summary field is used as the tooltip.   If there are a large number of bug IDs in a changeset, it can take
  some time for the query to finish - this will slow page loads in Hudson.  It is recommended that regex tuning
  be done with tooltips disabled.  Once the regex is selecting the right text, then enable tooltips.
  
  <br>Tooltips use Bugzilla's XMLRPC interface, which was first introduced in <b>Bugzilla 3.0</b>; older versions
  of Bugzilla will not be able to use this feature.
